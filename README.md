## Project Description

This project is inspired by Sonya's freshman year roommate, Evelyn Ferrall, who would constantly ask Sonya whether the dining hall was open and will probably never get around the memorizing the hours. This app solves as simple of a problem as it sounds: Is the dining hall open, and if so, which one?

## Protoype Summary

This is a mobile app created on Android Studio written in Java. There are two buttons; one for each of the two dining halls at Bryn Mawr College (Erdman and New Dorm). When a user clicks one, the app will determine whether the dining hall is currently open or not, and tells the user the appropriate response. If the dining hall is open, there will be a link to view the mobile-friendly menu webpage.

We would have liked to extract the Dining hall hours from the original web pages, as well as expand to Haverford and Swarthmore College's Dining halls. The data that we are extracting from isn't being read in from a website, but even powerful tools like regular expressions would have made this a time consuming and tedious task.

## Presentation

## Next Steps

Next steps would be: 

1) If a dining hall is closed, figuring out when it will be open.
2) Extracting the information directly from the websites 
3) Maybe instead of Android
